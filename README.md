# BoardGame

## Rule

When the game is started the program must ask for the names of the players.

Consider a game board consisting of **3x3** cells, each of which can contain a piece of stone, and a set of colored (red, yellow, and green) stones. The board is initially empty. Players move in turn, they have the following options:

- Placing a red stone into an empty cell
- Replacing a red stone on the board with a yellow stone
- Replacing a yellow stone on the board with a green stone.

## Goal

The goal of the game is to have three stones of the same color in a **row**, **column**, or **diagonal**. The player who achieves this with his or her move wins the game.
